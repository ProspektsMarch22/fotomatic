# Fotomatic
## A Web Responsiveness Project - HTML / CSS
#### Part of Codecademy's Fullstack Carreer Path

In this project, i followed a design spec for three different layouts for the same landing page - a desktop, tablet and smartphone one. 

You can look at the spec following [this link](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png), thus comparing it to my work.

I am open to sugestions and critique!
